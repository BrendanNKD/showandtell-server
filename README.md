Express Node.js Server
This repository contains an Express Node.js server that serves as a backend for your application. It provides a foundation for building robust and scalable web applications using the Express framework.

Prerequisites
Before running the server, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (version latest)
yarn (Package Manager)
Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the server up and running:
- yarn build
- yarn start
This will start the server on http://localhost:3000.

Configuration
You can modify the server configuration by editing the config.js. This file contains various settings such as port number, database connection details, API keys, etc.

Project Structure
The project structure is a clean architecture design organized as follows:

├── app
|   ├── src
│     ├── config       // Handles HTTP requests and responses
│     ├── data            // Custom error types and handling logic
│     ├── domain            // Business/domain models
│     ├── infrastructure      // Data access layer, interacts with databases or external services
│     ├── presentation          // Business logic layer, implements use cases
│     └── utils             // Utility functions and shared code
├── test.ts   
├── main.ts             // Web server setup and initialization
└── server.ts             // Router setup and route definitions

app: This directory contains the core application logic.

config: Holds configuration files and environment variables. It allows the application's settings to be easily modified without changing the code.
data: Contains files related to the database, such as migrations (scripts to create or modify database schema) and seed data (predefined data to populate the database for testing or initialization).
domain: Represents business/domain models that encapsulate the application's core entities and logic.
infrastructure: Implements the data access layer, providing an abstraction over data persistence mechanisms like databases or external services.
domain: Contains the business logic layer, responsible for implementing use cases and coordinating interactions between different components.
utils: Contains utility functions and shared code that can be used throughout the application.

tests.ts: Contains all the test-related files, including unit tests, integration tests, and any test utilities or fixtures.
main.ts: The entry point of the application, responsible for bootstrapping and setting up the application. It initializes dependencies, middleware, and starts the server.
server.ts: Handles web server setup and initialization, such as configuring middleware, defining routes, and starting the server.
